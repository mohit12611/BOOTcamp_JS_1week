Task 1
Do a write up for the followings:

oo) Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2
==> HTTP1.1 makes loading a web page more resource-intensive. 
Practices like concatenation, data inlining, and domain sharding in an attempt to fix the underlying problems of the protocol.


HTTP2 is binary, instead of textual
HTTP2 is fully multiplexed, instead of ordered and blocking
HTTP2 can, therefore, use one connection for parallelism
HTP2 uses header compression to reduce overhead
HTTP2 allows servers to “push” responses proactively into client caches

oo) HTTP version history
==>  

	1991	0.9
	1996	1.0
	1997	1.1
	2015	2.0
Draft  (2020)	3.0

oo) List 5 differences between Browser JS vs Node Js.
==> in Node.js 					Browser jsthing
	-building a Node.js application.		-Building apps that run in the browser is a completely different thing
	-you control the environment			-you don’t get the luxury to choose what browser your visitors will use
	-CommonJS module system				-ES Modules standard being implemented.
	  require()					-import
							we don’t have all the nice APIs that Node.js

oo) what happens when you type a URL in the address bar in the browser?
==>
You enter a URL into a web browser
The browser looks up the IP address for the domain name via DNS
The browser sends a HTTP request to the server
The server sends back a HTTP response
The browser begins rendering the HTML
The browser sends requests for additional objects embedded in HTML (images, css, JavaScript) and repeats steps 3-5.
Once the page is loaded, the browser sends further async requests as needed.
